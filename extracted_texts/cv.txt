**Medical Drug Sales Prediction based on Specific areas in SriLanka (July 2024 â€“ dec 2024)**
My First Research paper published by IEEE. Developed a medical drug sales prediction system for specific areas in Sri Lanka
using Python, Time Series Models (ARIMA, SARIMAX), and deployed a public website. This project was accepted for the
**International Research Conference on Smart Computing and System Engineering 2025.**

**Songs Recommendation system Based on Emotion and Melody**
Developed a machine learning and AI-based system to predict songs based on user emotions and melodies, offering a personalized
music experience. Unlike traditional streaming platforms that focus only on genre-based recommendations, this system analyzes
user emotions and melody preferences to provide highly relevant song suggestions. The project was selected for the final 10 in the
Intellihack AI Hackathon, organized by UCSC.

**Tensor-flow Individual Projects**
Worked on beginner-level AI projects using TensorFlow, Keras, and Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn to
build and implement machine learning models. These projects helped enhance my understanding of AI concepts and hands-on
experience with deep learning models

**Machine Learning Individual Projects**
Developed various beginner machine learning projects using models such as KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Linear
Regression. Notable projects include Classification Using KNN for classification tasks, Digits Prediction and Digits Predicting for
image-based predictions, HR Classifier for employee attrition prediction, and Heart Prediction for predicting heart disease. I also
worked on Spam Messages Classification to identify spam messages, Wine Classification for predicting wine quality, and Apple
Stock Prediction using time-series data. These projects utilized Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn
for data analysis and model development.

As a member of the University of Kelaniya Tennis Team, I competed in regional and national tournaments over two years.
I led the team to victory in the Inter-Faculty Tournament and helped secure the Runner-Up position in the 2023 Inter-
University Tournament. These experiences enhanced my teamwork, leadership, discipline, and focus under pressure,
which I apply in both my academic and professional life.
**AI Research Assistant Intern  (November 2024 - January 2025)**
Worked on AI projects focusing on building generative AI models for Sri Lankan native languages, including Sinhala and
Tamil. Our team collected a corpus of 40 million Tamil and Sinhala words, contributing to language model development.
I gained hands-on experience in data analysis and preprocessing, enhancing the models' accuracy and relevance for
native speakers. The project involved generative AI, computer vision, and audio generation, applying real-life data for
improved solutions.
